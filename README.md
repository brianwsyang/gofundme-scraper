West Big Data Hub Discovery Project: Data Enabled Donation Processing

At first, the project was more about the challenges of properly allocating physical donations to the disaster victims. Although there were more than enough donors, there was a lack of manpower to inventory and distribute an unorganized mess of donations in most cases. In our research to track how physical donations are processed, we learned that even large organizations just neglected keeping an inventory of donations because they simply didn't prioritize it as much as directly deploying people to actively help victims in the field. As a result, it was nearly impossible to track any information on physical donation. So we decided to hold off on this part of the project until we can procure some kind of proxy within these relief organizations.

Having reached an impasse with physical donations, we were curious how donations were processed financially. Since GoFundMe offers a rather reliable source of data, we decided to make this scraper in order to analyze how financially donations were managed.

Currently, the scraper does not work well with fundraisers that have already closed because most of the information is removed once that happens.
